A CMS with a database is unneeded complexity for a simple site (not naive: as long as you can deal with it).

In this case, a static site generator is just the right decision.
It makes the site faster (S3), removes complexity, and eliminates the need to run a server.

Before the change, this used to run [Ghost](ghost.org). Ghost is great, and I really liked it,
much more than I ever did WordPress. It is just a different way of publishing, and I will still recommend
Ghost to anyone who just wants a simple blog.

This site is now hosted on Amazon S3, and is generated by a custom node.js generator (using [metalsmith](metalsmith.io)).
It is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/alexanderselzer/slzr.co.git). There is no need to make such things private.
